# Streamlit Resume 

Streamlit is supposed to be the fastest and easiest way to host and share analytical apps. Something that sounded too good to be true, I decided to check it out. 
And it checks out. I created this resume in 3 hours and hosted it on an free EC2 instance. 

It has an extensive documentation and overall its very easy to use.
