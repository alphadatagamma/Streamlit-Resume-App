## The Project
I came across **Streamlit** last week while looking for solution to host python apps on AWS EC2.
The Framework  boasts of being the easiest and the fastest way of creating interactive apps, and after spending just a
few hours creating this interactive resume, I can vouch for that.

Check out my [**GitHub**]() for the implementation. Reach out to me for any project or a simple discussion on Streamlit.
Also check out their [**page**](https://www.streamlit.io/) for more more information and updates.
Also check out this amazing implementation of Streamlit by [**Marc Skov Madsen**](http://awesome-streamlit.org/) for streamlit inspiration.
